# Emacs Wunderlist

This project serves two primary purposes for me:

- Learn (emacs) Lisp, i.e. `'(car cdr cadr)` to my heart's content
- Build a Wunderlist plugin I can use from emacs to manage my day-to-day tasks

My ultimate goal is to get this plugin working well enough that MELPA will host it.
